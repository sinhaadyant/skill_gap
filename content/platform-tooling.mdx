## 1. DevOps Culture, CALMS & Collaboration

### Concept Brief
DevOps extends beyond tooling—CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing) promotes collaboration between development, operations, QA, and security.

### Why It Matters
- **Velocity**: Shared ownership shortens Bhopal release cycles.
- **Reliability**: Teams monitor and own services end-to-end.
- **Resilience**: Blameless postmortems and knowledge sharing prevent repeat incidents.

### Practical Walkthrough
- Adopt shared incident channels (`#bhopal-oncall`).
- Run blameless postmortems with action items tracked in Jira.
- Rotate developers through on-call/shadow rotations.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you measure DevOps maturity (DORA metrics)?
- What practices sustain collaboration across distributed teams?
- How do you institutionalize blameless postmortems and learning reviews?

## 2. Continuous Integration Foundations

### Concept Brief
Continuous Integration (CI) ensures every change integrates with mainline daily (or more). Mandatory tests and quality gates build trust in rapid delivery.

### Why It Matters
- **Reliability**: Detect integration problems within minutes.
- **Feedback**: Keep Bhopal squads confident to merge frequently.
- **Scalability**: Automated checks prevent human bottlenecks.

### Practical Walkthrough
```yaml
# GitHub Actions CI skeleton
name: bhopal-ci
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  push:
    branches: ["main", "release/**"]
jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 17
      - run: mvn -Pbhopal clean verify
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- What DORA metrics (deployment frequency, MTTR, change fail rate) do you track?
- How do you keep pipelines under target runtime thresholds?
- How do you quarantine flaky tests and prevent them from blocking merges?

---

## 3. Jenkins Pipeline Creation & Shared Libraries

### Concept Brief
Jenkins declarative and scripted pipelines orchestrate builds, tests, security scans, and deployments. Shared libraries reuse pipeline logic across repos.

### Why It Matters
- **Consistency**: Every Bhopal service follows the same stages.
- **Extensibility**: Update shared steps once, propagate everywhere.
- **Audit**: Pipelines log artifact provenance for compliance.

### Practical Walkthrough
```groovy
@Library('bhopal-shared@main') _

pipeline {
  agent { label 'linux' }
  options { timestamps(); ansiColor('xterm') }
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') { steps { checkout scm } }
    stage('Build & Unit Test') { steps { mvnBuild('bhopal-services') } }
    stage('Static Analysis') { steps { sonarScan() } }
    stage('Quality Gate') {
      steps {
        timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
          waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy to Staging') {
      when { branch 'main' }
      steps { helmDeploy('bhopal-staging') }
    }
  }
  post {
    success { slackNotify("✅ Build ${env.BUILD_TAG} successful") }
    failure { slackNotify("❌ Build ${env.BUILD_TAG} failed") }
  }
}
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- When do you use scripted pipelines instead of declarative?
- How do you secure credentials (Jenkins credentials store, Vault integration)?
- How do you version and test Jenkins shared libraries?

---

## 4. SonarQube Integration & Quality Gates

### Concept Brief
SonarQube enforces code quality by scanning for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, duplications, and coverage gaps.

### Why It Matters
- **Governance**: Maintain Bhopal code health across microservices.
- **Automation**: Block merges when quality drops.
- **Transparency**: Dashboards expose hotspots and technical debt.

### Practical Walkthrough
```properties
# sonar-project.properties
sonar.projectKey=bhopal-platform
sonar.sources=src/main/java
sonar.tests=src/test/java
sonar.java.binaries=target/classes
sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml
sonar.qualitygate.wait=true
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you enforce quality gates without blocking urgent patches?
- When do you waive Sonar issues and how do you document the rationale?
- How do you monitor trends (leak period, new debt) post-release?

---

## 5. Containerization & Image Build Strategies

### Concept Brief
Docker, Buildpacks, and Jib package services with dependencies. Multi-stage builds, slim bases, and caching reduce image size.

### Why It Matters
- **Reproducibility**: Same image from dev to prod.
- **Security**: Hardened base images mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: Small images push faster through registries.

### Practical Walkthrough
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
ARG JAR_FILE=target/bhopal-order.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you scan and sign container images (Trivy, Cosign)?
- When do you choose Buildpacks vs Dockerfiles vs Jib?
- How do you manage multi-architecture (ARM/AMD) build pipelines?

---

## 6. Kubernetes Deployments, Services & Config Management

### Concept Brief
Kubernetes orchestrates container workloads. Deployments manage pods; Services expose them; ConfigMaps/Secrets inject configuration.

### Why It Matters
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale Bhopal APIs during flash sales.
- **Resilience**: Self-healing pods maintain uptime.
- **Isolation**: Namespaces per region segregate resources.

### Practical Walkthrough
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bhopal-order
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bhopal-order
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: bhopal-order
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: order
          image: registry.local/bhopal-order:1.2.3
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef: { name: bhopal-order-config }
            - secretRef: { name: bhopal-order-secrets }
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet: { path: /actuator/health/readiness, port: 8080 }
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
            periodSeconds: 10
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you manage secrets (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets Operator, Vault)?
- What rollout strategies (rolling, blue/green, canary) do you employ and when?
- How do you debug failing pods (`kubectl describe`, logs, `stern`)?

---

## 7. Helm Charts, GitOps & Progressive Delivery

### Concept Brief
Helm templating packages Kubernetes manifests. GitOps (Argo CD, Flux) syncs desired state from Git, enabling declarative deployments and progressive rollouts.

### Why It Matters
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for Bhopal environments.
- **Safety**: Git history tracks every config change.
- **Progressive Delivery**: Argo Rollouts/Flagger enable canaries and blue/green.

### Practical Walkthrough
```yaml
# values-bhopal.yaml
replicaCount: 4
image:
  repository: registry.local/bhopal-order
  tag: 1.2.3
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
config:
  region: bhopal
```
```bash
helm upgrade --install bhopal-order charts/order -f values-bhopal.yaml --namespace bhopal
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you structure GitOps repos (app vs environment repos)?
- When do you use Helmfile or Kustomize alongside Helm?
- How do you roll back GitOps changes quickly (revert commit vs manual patch)?

---

## 8. Kafka Operations, Retry & Dead Letter Queues

### Concept Brief
Kafka underpins asynchronous messaging. Producers publish events; consumers handle them with retry policies, DLQs, and observability.

### Why It Matters
- **Reliability**: Prevent data loss in Bhopal event pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Partitioning supports burst traffic.
- **Observability**: Lag metrics and alerts prevent backlog crises.

### Practical Walkthrough
```java
@Bean
public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, OrderEvent> kafkaListenerContainerFactory(
        ConsumerFactory<String, OrderEvent> consumerFactory) {
    var factory = new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, OrderEvent>();
    factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory);
    factory.setCommonErrorHandler(new DefaultErrorHandler(
        new DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer(kafkaTemplate),
        new FixedBackOff(1000L, 3)));
    factory.setConcurrency(3);
    return factory;
}
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- Which metrics (consumer lag, processing time, DLQ volume) drive alerts?
- How do you evolve schemas (Schema Registry, protobuf, Avro compatibility)?
- How do you size partitions and tune consumer concurrency?

---

## 9. Secrets Management & DevSecOps

### Concept Brief
Secure secrets with vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), enforce least privilege, and integrate security scans (SAST, DAST, dependency checks) into pipelines.

### Why It Matters
- **Security**: Keep Bhopal credentials out of repos.
- **Compliance**: Satisfy audit requirements (SOX, GDPR).
- **DevSecOps**: Embed security early in the pipeline.

### Practical Walkthrough
```bash
vault kv put bhopal/orders DB_USER=bhopal_user DB_PASS=secret

# Jenkins with Vault plugin
withVault([vaultSecrets: [[path: 'bhopal/orders', secretValues: [[envVar: 'DB_USER', vaultKey: 'DB_USER'], [envVar: 'DB_PASS', vaultKey: 'DB_PASS']]]]]) {
  sh './deploy.sh'
}
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you rotate secrets without downtime?
- What scanners (OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy, Snyk) run in CI?
- How do you handle secrets in GitOps (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets)?

---

## 10. Jira Automation, Reporting & Flow Metrics

### Concept Brief
Jira automation ties commits/PRs to tickets, transitions workflow states, and generates sprint/flow metrics (cycle time, throughput).

### Why It Matters
- **Traceability**: Each BHOPAL ticket reflects code changes.
- **Visibility**: Exec-level dashboards show delivery health.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual board maintenance.

### Practical Walkthrough
```json
{
  "trigger": "Pull request merged",
  "condition": "PR title contains BHOPAL-",
  "action": [
    "Transition issue to Done",
    "Comment: PR {{pullRequest.url}} merged by {{pullRequest.author}}"
  ]
}
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you prevent automation loops or incorrect transitions?
- What flow metrics (cycle time, WIP limits) do you monitor?
- How do you integrate deployment status back into Jira dashboards?

---

## 11. Observability, SLOs & Alerting

### Concept Brief
Combine metrics, logs, and traces to measure Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and track error budgets. Alerting routes incidents to on-call teams with actionable context.

### Why It Matters
- **Reliability**: Maintain Bhopal SLAs with measurable error budgets.
- **Speed**: Alert fatigue reduction via tuned thresholds.
- **Insights**: Trace correlations between CI failures and runtime incidents.

### Practical Walkthrough
```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: bhopal-slo
spec:
  groups:
    - name: availability
      rules:
        - record: bhopal_order_service:sli_availability
          expr: sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count{status=~"2.."}[5m])) /
                sum(rate(http_server_requests_seconds_count[5m]))
        - alert: BhopalOrderSLOBurn
          expr: (1 - bhopal_order_service:sli_availability) > 0.02
          for: 5m
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you define and monitor error budgets?
- When do you escalate incidents (paging vs chat ops)?
- How do you correlate CI/CD events with production regressions?

---

## 12. Cost Management & FinOps Considerations

### Concept Brief
Monitor infrastructure spend (compute, storage, data transfer), allocate costs per environment/team, and optimize idle resources.

### Why It Matters
- **Budget Control**: Keep Bhopal cloud costs predictable.
- **Accountability**: Showback/chargeback to product teams.
- **Optimization**: Identify idle clusters, overprovisioned pods, unused CI runners.

### Practical Walkthrough
- Tag Kubernetes nodes/pods with `team=bhopal` labels for cost attribution.
- Use Kubecost or AWS Cost Explorer dashboards.
- Schedule dev clusters to scale down outside working hours.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you monitor cost anomalies in near real-time?
- What policies govern cluster auto-scaling vs right-sizing?
- How do you include cost reviews in sprint retrospectives?

---

## 13. Incident Response & Runbooks

### Concept Brief
Document runbooks, incident checklists, escalation paths, and after-action reviews. Automate incident creation (PagerDuty, Opsgenie) tied to alerts.

### Why It Matters
- **Preparedness**: Bhopal on-call teams respond quickly.
- **Knowledge**: Runbooks capture tribal knowledge.
- **Improvement**: Action items feed back into backlog.

### Practical Walkthrough
- Store runbooks in Git (`ops/runbooks/bhopal-order.md`).
- Automate incident creation on pager alerts with severity mapping.
- Conduct post-incident reviews with action item tracking in Jira.

### Follow-Up Questions
- How do you keep runbooks up to date?
